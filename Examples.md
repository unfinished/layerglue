## Utility examples ##

The library does not have to be used in it's entirety, and specific classes (or groups of classes) can be used independently. These examples demonstrate several important utilities, all of which can be used separately from the MVC navigation framework.

  1. **[Substitution](ExampleSubstitution.md)** - Simple multi-language substitution using simple xml or Excel files
  1. **[Deserialization](ExampleDeserialization.md)** - Automated deserialization of xml into custom value object classes
  1. **[Substitution and Deserialization](ExampleSubstitutionAndDeserialization.md)** - A combination of examples 1 and 2
  1. **[Workflow](ExampleWorkflow.md)** - Substitution and deserialization worked into a more structured project and including Ant build files
  1. **[Styling](ExampleStyling.md)** - Applying localised styling to an application through the use of CSS and workflow enhancements
  1. **[Preloading](ExamplePreloading.md)** - Unified preloading of the main application swf and supporting assets into a single measurable process


## Navigation examples ##

The key part of the library is a navigable MVC framework that supports browser integration. This means that sections of the site are deep-linkable, and navigation to and from these sections can be automated by the underlying system.
