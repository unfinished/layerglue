# Welcome to the LayerGlue ActionScript library #

## Introduction ##

LayerGlue is an ActionScript 3 library aimed at rapid website and application development. The library contains everything from low level utility classes to a navigable MVC framework that supports browser integration.


## Features ##

  * **MVC:** Event-driven architecture that's based on common MVC concepts used in other frameworks such as Cairngorm.

  * **Navigable site structure:** Allows structural definitions of sites to be defined as XML and translated into an MVC architecture.

  * **Browser integration:** Underlying navigation system manages deep-linking and automates the transition between areas of the application.

  * **Multi-language:** Multi-language support, including locale-specific configurations and regional font encoding.

  * **Workflow:** Conventions for common workflow processes using Ant.


## Aims ##

One of the aims of the library is to be modular, providing entry points for developers of different levels and different skill sets, so try out the examples below or checkout the library from the following address:

https://layerglue.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/actionscript3/trunk/source

**Note: The library is currently in an alpha form and may undergo API changes in the near future. A beta release version will be tagged soon, but in the meantime please export from the trunk rather than using svn:externals.**
